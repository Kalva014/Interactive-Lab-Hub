# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Read about Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).
2. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
3. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.


### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. 7 Storyboards
1. 3 Sketches/photos of costumed devices
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of 3 prototyped interactions
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Part A. Plan 

To stage an interaction with your interactive device, think about:

_Setting:_ The interaction happens at a study table.

_Players:_ A group of students

_Activity:_ What is happening between the students is they are taking a break having a conversation. 

_Goals:_ What are the goals of each player? The goals of the students is to start studying after taking a break or stop studying and take a break depending on the color of the light. 

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*
John Doe is a student. Whenever he studies his friends come to talk to him which makes him take a very long and unnecessary break. However taking these long breaks frustrates John as it affects his grades. Therefore he uses the study break indicator. The device shows the color green indicating John to go study. After a specific set time, the device will turn red indicating john to take a break. By repeating this, John was able to improve his grades by taking the appropriate amount of time to take a break and study.

\*\***Include pictures of your storyboards here**\*\*

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*
- The student intuitively should put the device in a location that can be seen
- You have to add a feature to calibrate how long it'll for breaks and studying
- Try to have the color blink because if it just turns red or green then the user will get used to the color and ignore it

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*
Putting up the device was harder than it seemed so had to figure out a way to prop up the device. Just the color changing did not capture the user's attention very well.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*
Maybe add noise or some sound indicator to capture user attention.


## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can can manually or remotely control.

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*
The tool was very interesting as it could be applied to many smart led and home systems. I believe there are many applications for it.

## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*

## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop three costumes so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***Include sketches of what your devices might look like here.**\*\*
![IMG_9529](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46539140/186989149-49823b67-c172-4205-b1ad-7aa54e3b6e40.jpg)

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*
Inspired by traffic lights, I decided to make the device into a box with a cone on top to direct the light to the student studying for better capture.


## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*
Calvin Tirrell: Paper cutout on phone could be more cleanly cut vs being torn/ripped out. Otherwise, the storyline and video were easy to understand and a good use of the interactive device concept.
Keyur Shah: Add some noise and a snooze option if the user is close to finishing their assignment.
Yunus Ansari: Thinks it could be improved in design/aesthetics. Nevertheless the idea can be very useful

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative! Feel free to fork and modify the tinkerbell code! 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
To stage an interaction with your interactive device, think about:

_Setting:_ The bedroom.

_Players:_ One person.

_Activity:_ What is happening is the user wants to decide what colors would be more aesthetic for their outfit of the day. 

_Goals:_ What are the goals of each player? The goal of the player is to find an aesthetic outfit

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*
John Doe is a fashion student. He loves to dress well, however he has a hard time choosing what outfit to wear since he has a lot of clothes. In result he pulls out his color coordination device to help him decide what colors compliment each other. 

\*\***Include pictures of your storyboards here**\*\*

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*
There needs to be a larger palette of colors to choose from.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*
There could be multiple variations and shades of the colors for better fitting. Also can notify the user using vibrations for when the color of the day is.


## Part C. Prototype the device


## Part D. Wizard the device

## Part E. Costume the device
\*\***Include sketches of what your devices might look like here.**\*\*![IMG_9571 HEIC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46539140/187927663-c2c5bdb9-f374-4e2d-9202-45bca0d6a8b8.png)![IMG_9570 HEIC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46539140/187927683-cc4243c9-3630-402b-92aa-06f719fcbb8b.png)

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*
The opportunity to be able to see yourself with the color on could change how you perceive the color with your outfit.

## Part F. Record
